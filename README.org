* What?
A streamcast metadata capture tool and an IRC bot.  It's a work-in-progress
on both fronts and needs some cleanup.
It's also my first rebar based Erlang project.
* How?
Learn about rebar.  Use google.  Learn how to launch erlang stuff.
When this is less of a work in progress I'll make it easier to launch.
* Why?
Wanted to stretch out a little bit and re-excersise some old knowledge.
* Warranty?
NO. I make no claim that this works at all or doesn't somehow ruin 
your life or business.  You assume all risk by using it.  The 
code is public domain.  Use it as you like.
* License
Public domain.  I really don't care.
